## Welcome to QuACK! 
QuACK is a data-analysis workshop series for incoming psychology grads, created by and taught by Psych grads!


### Our Goals
  **Goal 1:** Give incoming students foundational skills in data analysis and R in preparation for Psych-205 in the Spring.
  
  
  **Goal 2:** Create an inclusive, supportive, and positive space for learning quantitative and coding skills; contribute to cohortâ€™s community building!
